This is nothing but a markdown reminder to me.

**bold** is made with two asterisks (**)
_italic_ is made with a single underscore (_)
~~strikeout~~ is made with double tilde (~~)


Quoted text is made

> ...by using a greater than symbol 

In-line `code` is formed using backtickd(`) while,
```
code blocks;
use triple backticks;
```

Links are made by putting the link text in square brackets and the url in parentheses, [click here](http://cdtyrrell.github.io).

Images are similar to links, but preceded by an exclamation point (!). The square brackets contain the alt text and parentheses the image url ![Bamboo photo taken by Mokkie](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Bamboo_tree.jpg/337px-Bamboo_tree.jpg)
